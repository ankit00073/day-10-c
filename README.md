To create the interactive circle webpage with the ability to change its color and shape using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I accomplished the task in the following steps:<br />

**1.HTML Structure (index.html):**<br />
  Created a basic HTML structure with a <div> element to represent the circle.<br />
  Added two buttons: "Change Color" and "Change Shape."<br />


**2.CSS Styling (style.css):**<br />
  Styled the circle with CSS to give it an initial color, size, and shape.<br />
  Used CSS to define the transition properties for smooth visual effects during changes<br />


**3.JavaScript Functionality (index.js):**<br />
  Added event listeners to the "Change Color" and "Change Shape" buttons.<br />
  Created functions to handle button clicks and update the circle accordingly.<br />
